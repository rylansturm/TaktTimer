Hello, world!

If you are reading this you likely already have the first few steps of this done! So congrats.

For my own notes, and for those following along at home, here are the commands I entered in the
terminal on a Raspberry Pi to get it from fresh install to Takt Timer ready.

As of 9/14/2018 this list is almost certainly incomplete. Sorry. It's just my best notes so far.


$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install xscreensaver

# Open xscreensaver from the gui and disable screensaver or edit ~/.xscreensaver file - "mode:  off"

$ mkdir TaktTimer
$ cd TaktTimer
$ git init
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/rylansturm/TaktTimer
$ git pull origin master
$ sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb


IF SERVER:
$    sudo apt-get install mysql-server
$    # edit the mysql .cnf file found in /etc/mysql
$    # you are looking for the "bind-address=127.0.0.1"
$    # mine was different from the tutorial I followed, and was at /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
$    # edit "bind-address=127.0.0.1" to read "bind-address=<your.ip.address.here>"
$    # save and close the file
$    sudo service restart mysql
$    mysql -u root -p
$        >(enter the password you created)
$        >CREATE DATABASE timers; (or area name?)
$        # the next two lines will be needed for each user on the network
$        # It will also be necessary to add the server pi as a user. I used the same 'worker' name for it.
$        # privileges can be more specific, and probably should be for security, but here's a start
$        # quotes are necessary
$        >CREATE USER 'worker'@'<ipaddress>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
$        >GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON timers.* TO 'worker'@'<ipaddress>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
$        >FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

As long as models.create_db() and models.create_session() both point to the Pi where you want
the server to be located, you should be set. The installer will eventually do that for you...
So change those two functions to have the correct ip address of the Pi that is acting as the
server. Any Pi on the network can act as the "server" in terms of being the one that sets the
demand and schedule, but the server in this instance must be the one that hosts the mysql database.


if you're not still there, cd on back to ~/TaktTimer and run:
$ python3 Timer.py

Whichever computer is going to be the 'server' in terms of setting demand and schedule can be
installed as type 'Server.' All others should be type 'Worker.'  You can edit this manually
in the 'install.ini' file. Ignore the 'file' option in the installer if it is still there...
it is unnecessary.
